/*
 * Vector is a collection type that addresses the inefficiency for random access on lists. 
 * Vectors allow accessing any element of the list in ¡°effectively¡± constant time
 * 
 * algorithms using vectors do not have to be careful about accessing just the head of the sequence. 
 * They can access and modify elements at arbitrary locations
 * 
 * Vectors are represented as trees with a high branching factor 
 * So for all vectors of reasonable size, an element selection involves up to 5 primitive array selections.
 * 
 * Updating an element in the middle of a vector can be done by copying the node that contains the element, 
 * and every node that points to it, starting from the root of the tree
 * This is certainly more expensive than an in-place update in a mutable array, 
 * but still a lot cheaper than copying the whole vector
 * 
 * vectors strike a good balance between fast random selections and fast random functional updates
