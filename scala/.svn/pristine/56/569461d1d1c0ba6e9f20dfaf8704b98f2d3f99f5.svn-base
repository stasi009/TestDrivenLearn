   * difference between Ordered and Ordering is that: 
   * Ordered is a property of the element: if element has "ordered" property, then it can be sorted
   * Ordering is a strategy. Even the element doesn't have "ordered" property, we can design a strategy
   * to sort them, or, develop several sorting strategy
   * 
   * ordered is static: when the element type is fixed, its Ordered property is also fixed
   * each item type can only have one Ordered property
   * 
   * Ordering is dynamic, which is detached from the element type. 
   * one element type can have several different Ordering strategy, and can be switched at runtime
