            on W3C School</a></h1>
    <h2>
        Static Positioning</h2>
    <p class="note">
        HTML elements are positioned static <span class="attention">by default</span>. A
        static positioned element is always positioned according to the normal flow of the
        page.</p>
    <h2>
        Fixed Positioning</h2>
    <ul class="note">
        <li>An element with fixed position is positioned relative to the browser window</li>
        <li>It will not move even if the window is scrolled</li>
        <li>Fixed positioned elements are <span class="attention">removed from the normal flow</span>.
            The document and other elements behave like the fixed positioned element does not
            exist.</li>
        <li>Fixed positioned elements can overlap other elements.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Relative Positioning</h2>
    <ul class="note">
        <li>A relative positioned element is positioned relative to its <span class="attention">
            normal</span> position.</li>
        <li>The content of relatively positioned elements can be moved and overlap other elements,
            but the reserved space for the element is still <span class="attention">preserved</span>
            in the normal flow.</li>
        <li>Relatively positioned elements are often used as container blocks for absolutely
            positioned elements.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Absolute Positioning</h2>
    <ul class="note">
        <li>An absolute position element is positioned relative to the first parent element
            that has a position other than static. If no such element is found, the containing
            block is &lt;html&gt;</li>
        <li>Absolutely positioned elements are <span class="attention">removed</span> from the
            normal flow. The document and other elements behave like the absolutely positioned
            element does not exist.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Z-Index</h2>
    <ul class="note">
        <li>The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element (which element should
            be placed in front of, or behind, the others</li>
        <li>An element can have a positive or negative stack order</li>
        <li>An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower
            stack order.</li>
        <li>If two positioned elements overlap, without a z-index specified, the element positioned
            last in the HTML code will be shown on top.</li>
    </ul>
