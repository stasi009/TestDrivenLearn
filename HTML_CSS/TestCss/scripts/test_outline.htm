            An outline is a line that is drawn around elements <span class="attention">(outside the borders)</span> to make the element "stand out".
            <br/>
            However, the outline property is different from the border property.
            <span class="attention">
                The outline is not a part of an element's dimensions; 
                the element's total width and height is not affected by the width of the outline.
            </span>
            <br/>
