    <h1>by default, HTML doesn't preserve Line Breakers</h1>
    <p>
    This paragraph
contains a lot of lines
in the source code,
but the browser 
ignores it.
    </p>

    <h1>HTML also doesn't preserve white space</h1>
    <p>This paragraph
contains             a lot of spaces
in the source     code,
but the    browser 
ignores it <b>and merge multiple whitespace into one</b>.</p>

    <h1>use "br /" to start new line</h1>
    <p>
    line 1<br />



    line 2<br />



    line 3<br />
    </p>

    <h1 style="color:red;">pre-formatted text</h1>
    <pre>
    This is
    preformatted text.
    It preserves      both spaces
    and line breaks.
    </pre>

    <p>The pre tag is good for displaying computer code:</p>

    <pre>
    for i = 1 to 10
         print i
    next i
    </pre>
